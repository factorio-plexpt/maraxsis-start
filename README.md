## Maraxsis Start

    Seablock without the block.

This mod is a full inversion of the tech tree where you will start on [Maraxsis: The Drowned Planet](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/maraxsis).

Start with advanced technologies such as foundries, pressure domes, and hydro plants.
Eventually with enough research, visit the far-away world of Nauvis to unlock burner mining drills and wooden power poles.

This mod edits as few recipes as possible. It only changes the order of technologies in the tech tree to make a Maraxsis start possible.
The only edited recipes are:

- Stone centrifuging: Uranium ore output multiplied by 10x.
- Hydro plant: Blue chips swapped with green chips.
- Fishing tower: Removed agricultural towers. Agricultural towers now require fishing towers instead.
